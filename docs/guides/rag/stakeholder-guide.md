# RAG Stakeholder Guide

## Business Value

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) transforms generic AI into domain experts.
By connecting our AI agents to your specific business documents, we unlock
several key benefits:

### 1. Specialized Knowledge

Agents can answer questions based on your unique policies, guidelines, and
proprietary data, not just general internet knowledge.

### 2. Reduced Hallucinations

By grounding the AI's responses in retrieved facts, we significantly reduce the
risk of "hallucinations" (making things up), ensuring more accurate and
compliant outputs.

### 3. Data Privacy & Security

Your proprietary data stays within your secure environment (or your tenant's
isolated scope). We do not train public models on your data. RAG allows the AI
to "read" your documents at runtime without exposing them to the wider world.

### 4. Cost Efficiency

RAG is often more cost-effective than fine-tuning custom models. You can update
the knowledge base instantly by adding or removing documents, without expensive
re-training cycles.

## Use Cases

- **Underwriting**: Agents can reference specific lending criteria, risk
  matrices, and compliance checklists.
- **Customer Support**: Chatbots can answer inquiries using the latest product
  manuals and FAQs.
- **Legal & Compliance**: Automated review of contracts against internal legal
  standards.
