# AI User Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how end-users interact with AI features.

## Semantic Search
When using the search bar, you can type natural language queries.
-   **Example**: Instead of typing "error 500", you can type "server is crashing".
-   **How it works**: The system understands the meaning of "crashing" is related to "error 500".

## Recommendations
You may see "Recommended for you" sections. These are generated by analyzing your past interactions and finding similar items using AI.

## Troubleshooting
-   **Irrelevant Results**: If search results seem off, try providing more context in your query.
-   **Slow Performance**: Complex AI queries may take slightly longer than simple keyword searches.
