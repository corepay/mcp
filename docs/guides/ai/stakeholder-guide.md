# AI Stakeholder Guide

## Business Value
Integrating AI into the platform unlocks new product capabilities and operational efficiencies.

1.  **Enhanced User Experience**: Semantic search allows users to find what they mean, not just what they type.
2.  **Personalization**: Recommendation engines based on vector similarity can suggest relevant products or content.
3.  **Automation**: Intelligent document processing can automate data entry and classification tasks.

## Use Cases
-   **Support Chat**: Automatically finding relevant help articles based on user queries.
-   **Fraud Detection**: Identifying anomalous patterns in transaction data.
-   **Content Discovery**: Showing "Related Items" based on deep semantic similarity.

## Data Privacy
-   **Local Processing**: We prioritize running models locally or via secure, compliant APIs.
-   **Data Isolation**: Tenant data is strictly isolated, ensuring AI models do not leak information between customers.
