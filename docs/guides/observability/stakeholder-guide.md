# Observability Stakeholder Guide

## Business Value
Observability is critical for maintaining a high-quality user experience and operational efficiency.

1.  **Proactive Issue Resolution**: By monitoring system metrics, we can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks before they impact customers.
2.  **Data-Driven Decisions**: Usage metrics help us understand which features are most used and where to invest development resources.
3.  **Cost Optimization**: Efficient database queries (optimized via Index Advisor) reduce infrastructure costs by minimizing CPU and memory usage.

## Key Metrics
We track the following high-level indicators:

-   **Latency**: How fast the application responds to user requests.
-   **Throughput**: The number of requests the system can handle per second.
-   **Error Rate**: The percentage of failed requests.
-   **Saturation**: How fully utilized our system resources (CPU, Memory, DB) are.

## Reliability
Our observability stack ensures that we meet our Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for uptime and performance.
