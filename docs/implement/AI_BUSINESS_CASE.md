# 🚀 AI Business Opportunities & Feature Roadmap

Integrating AI into the Core Foundation isn't just about a chatbot; it's about
transforming **Mcp** from a passive system into an **active, intelligent
partner**.

Here is the "Exciting Stuff" that becomes possible with `AshAi` + `Ollama` deep
in the core:

## 1. 🧠 The "Sentient" Ledger (Finance & Audit)

Instead of just storing transactions, the system understands them.

- **Anomaly Detection**: "Hey, this merchant usually processes $5k/day, but just
  did $50k in an hour. Should I freeze it?" (Automated Risk).
- **Smart Reconciliation**: "I found a $20 discrepancy. It looks like a currency
  conversion error matching this specific pattern." (Auto-healing).
- **Natural Language Audits**: "Show me all transactions from last week that
  violated the new GDPR retention policy." (No SQL required).

## 2. 🛡️ Autonomous Compliance (GDPR & Legal)

Turn compliance from a burden into a background process.

- **Auto-Redaction**: AI automatically identifies and redacts PII in logs and
  support tickets before they leave the secure zone.
- **Policy Sentinel**: "You are trying to export data for a user who requested
  deletion. I have blocked this action." (Proactive enforcement).
- **Contract Analysis**: Upload a merchant contract, and the AI extracts fee
  structures and limits, auto-configuring the `Merchant` resource.

## 3. 💬 Conversational Commerce (Platform)

Empower merchants and admins with a "Chief of Staff."

- **"Chat with your Data"**: Merchants can ask, "Why did my revenue drop
  yesterday?" The AI analyzes `Payment` and `Refund` resources to find the cause
  (e.g., "High decline rate on Visa cards").
- **Smart Onboarding**: A conversational wizard that guides new merchants
  through complex KYC setups, validating documents in real-time.

## 4. ⚡ Supercharged Developer Experience (AshMCP)

- **Self-Healing Code**: When an exception occurs, the system feeds the stack
  trace + local context to a specialized coding model which proposes a fix
  directly in your IDE.
- **Living Documentation**: The AI keeps `docs/` in sync with code changes
  automatically.

## 🔮 The "Killer Feature": Agentic Workflows

This is where it gets wild. By exposing Ash Resources as **Tools**, you can
create autonomous agents.

- **Scenario**: A chargeback is received.
- **Agent Action**:
  1. Fetches transaction details.
  2. Compiles shipping proof from the `Logistics` domain.
  3. Generates a rebuttal letter citing relevant card network rules.
  4. Submits it to the payment processor.
  - _Human involvement: 0%_

## Why Local (Ollama)?

- **Privacy**: Financial data never leaves your infrastructure.
- **Cost**: $0 inference cost. Run 24/7 background agents without bankruptcy.
- **Control**: You own the "brain." No one can deprecate your model.
