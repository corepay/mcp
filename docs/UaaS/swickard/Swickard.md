# Proposal: The "Digital F&I Manager" for Swickard Auto Group

> **"Stop selling cars. Start selling certainty."**

## 1. Executive Summary: The Market Disruption

The automotive sales funnel is leaking. You spend millions on aggressive digital
marketing to drive traffic to your sites. Customers browse, get excited, and
then hit a wall of uncertainty: _"Can I afford this?"_

They leave your site to check their bank account or credit score. **You just
lost the lead.**

**The Solution**: Embed a **"Digital F&I Manager"** directly into your ads and
VDPs (Vehicle Detail Pages).

- **Not a Lead Form**: A lead form asks for data.
- **An Agent**: An Agent gives an _answer_.

We propose deploying **Agentic Underwriting** across all 50+ Swickard
dealerships to turn "Browsers" into "Pre-Qualified Buyers" instantly, 24/7,
without human intervention.

## 2. The "Buying Power" Widget (The Hook)

Imagine an Instagram Ad for a 2024 Rivian R1T. Instead of a "Learn More" button,
it says: **"Scan to see your payment."**

### The Customer Experience (Mobile First)

1. **Scan**: Customer scans the QR code or clicks the widget on the VDP.
2. **Verify**: "Hi, I'm Atlas. Scan your Driver's License to unlock your buying
   power." (No typing).
3. **Analyze**: Our AI Agent runs a "Soft Pull" (No credit impact) and analyzes
   income.
4. **The Reveal**: "Congratulations, John! You are pre-qualified for
   **$85,000**. This Rivian is yours for **$0 down**."

**Result**: The customer is now emotionally committed. They aren't hoping to
buy; they _know_ they can buy.

## 3. The Workflow: IRL

### Actor 1: The Customer (Friday, 11:00 PM)

John is browsing your site in bed. He sees a truck he loves.

- **Old Way**: Fills out a "Contact Me" form. Goes to sleep. Wakes up, forgets
  about it.
- **Swickard Way**: Interacts with the Agent. Gets a "Green Checkmark"
  pre-qualification. Schedules a test drive for Saturday morning.

### Actor 2: The Salesperson (Saturday, 8:30 AM)

Sarah arrives at the dealership. She opens her CRM.

- **Old Way**: "New Lead: John Doe. Phone Number." (Cold Call).
- **Swickard Way**: "New Deal: John Doe. **Status: Pre-Qualified ($85k)**.
  Verified Income. Trade-In: 2018 Ford F-150. **Action**: Have the Rivian pulled
  up front."

### Actor 3: The F&I Manager (Saturday, 10:00 AM)

John finishes the test drive. "I'll take it."

- **Old Way**: "Fill out this credit app." (30 mins). F&I Manager types it into
  Dealertrack. (30 mins). Banks fight. (1 hour). Customer waits.
- **Swickard Way**: The Agent has already structured the deal. The F&I Manager
  reviews the "Decision Memo" generated last night. Prints the paperwork. **John
  is driving off the lot in 20 minutes.**

### Actor 4: The Executive (Monday Morning)

You review the dashboard.

- **Insight**: "Our 'Aggressive Approval' agent at the Toyota store increased
  conversion by 22% this weekend."
- **Action**: "Deploy that same Instruction Set to the Honda store immediately."

## 4. The "Brain" Behind the Operation

This isn't just a calculator. It is an **AI Agent** trained on _your_ specific
lending policies.

### The "Swickard Instruction Set"

You control the risk. You configure the Agent's brain:

- **Inventory Rules**: "If the car is > 60 days on lot, relax the DTI
  requirement by 5%."
- **Lender Matching**: "If Credit Score > 750, route to Chase. If < 650, route
  to Santander."
- **Upsell Logic**: "If they qualify for $50k but are looking at a $40k car,
  suggest the 'Platinum Trim'."

## 5. Why This Wins

1. **Speed to Lead**: You engage the customer the _second_ they show interest.
2. **Certainty**: You remove the fear of rejection. A confident buyer closes
   faster.
3. **Efficiency**: Your F&I team stops chasing paper and starts selling products
   (Warranty, Gap).
4. **Data Moat**: You capture the customer's financial profile _before_ they
   ever walk into a competitor's showroom.

**The Bottom Line**: You are not just selling cars. You are providing a
**frictionless path to ownership**.
